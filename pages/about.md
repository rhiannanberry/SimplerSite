## ..myself #

My name is Rhiannan! I'm a Computer Science undergrad at Georgia Institute of Technology. I spend my free time running, making art, and developing videogames for myself and for Georgia Tech's game development club, [VGDev](http://vgdev.com). And in my not-free-time, I'm crying over classes, working at [Patientco](https://www.patientco.com) as a co-op/intern software engineer, *or* working at [IRIM](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu) as a pack mule.

Now that you've arrived. Please stay a while. And I promise I won't keep 
you long. <style>

## ..this blog #

I suppose I'm adding blogging to the list of ways I spend my free time. Expect infrequent write-ups on games I'm working on, tutorials on interesting math and programming things I've learned, maybe a few poorly crafted analyses of media I consume, and some philosophizing about my creative process.
