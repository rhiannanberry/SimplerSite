# Description
[**Download Page**](vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/game/clean-my-desk/)

My most recently lead game for [VGDev](http://vgdev.com)! It initially started as a personal project to do when I didn't want to clean my IRL desk, but I ended up getting convinced to pitch it to VGDev, and people were really into it, to my shock.

This is the first game where I really started exploring my comedic and personal voice, and started to find my style, and I'm just super proud of it :)

As with all games developed in VGDev, I made this with the extensive help of my team members, all of whom are credited on the game page.
