# Description

First little test of Lens Studio. Verdict: stupidly easy. Design was inspired by a project [Zach Lieberman](https://twitter.com/zachlieberman) did a while ago.

Unfortunately, this was made in the very early days of Lens Studio, and is currently defunct (I'll rewrite it one of these days!). Before it was lost to the sands of time (Snapchat updates), the filter amassed 60k uses.
