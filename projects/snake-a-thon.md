# Description

[**Download Page**](vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/game/snake-a-thon/)

My first solo lead game for [VGDev](http://vgdev.com)! This bad boy was made in GameMaker, and was inspired by my love of simple and addictive arcade-style games that have unlockable content which are purely aesthetic and in no way affect gameplay. The biggest influence for this project was Downwell, which I was playing non-stop at the time.

snake-a-thon (lowercase is intentional) is basically Snake, but the snake is not bound to orthogonal directions, and will always pursue the cursor. You must lead the snake around, picking up buffs and debuffs, all while not allowing the wiggly boy to run into the cursor, the walls, or himself. 

Despite the simplistic graphics and concept, snake-a-thon was a huge hit among members and those who played it at our demo event. This is a project I'd love to rewrite and expand upon some day soon.

As with all games developed in VGDev, I made this with the extensive help of my team members, all of whom are credited on the game page.
