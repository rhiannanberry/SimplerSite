# Description

[**Download Page**](vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/game/analog-dreams/)

First game that I co-lead in Georgia Tech's game development club, [VGDev](http://vgdev.com), with my fabulously talented friend, [Sean Flanagan](insertlinkhere). Analog Dreams is a 3D, physics-based, puzzle game, where you have to deliver a VHS tape to a VCR. 

As with all games developed in VGDev, I made this with the extensive help of my team members and co-lead, all of whom are credited on the game page. My primary contributions were the initial concept, project management, level/puzzle designs, and 3D art (some objects throughout the game, and the majority of the intro scene pictured below).
